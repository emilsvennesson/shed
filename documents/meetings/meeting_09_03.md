## Outcomes and assignments

**Agenda**:

- The agenda for each meeting will be written before each meeting. If anyone wants to add something, they will either update the document directly or contact Samuel.

**Questions for supervisor**: 

- Is the time invested in system integration for several API:s worth it or should we find alternatives?

- Pitch both ideas and ask for feedback.

- What GUI libraries are commonly used by students in this course? Are any recommended?

**Plan B**:

- Application for drinks and other alcoholic beverages. Using data from Systembolaget - implement price estimates for drinks, inspiration etc.
- We have this data scraped already, making it less system integration oriented.

**APIs**:

- We are leaning towards plan B as the course is focused on OOP design and not system integration, this will hopefully lead less painful development.

  - Look up Google cloud services to see if it is possible to make a RESTful API in case we need it.
